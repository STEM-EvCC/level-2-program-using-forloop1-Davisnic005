# STEM103_Level3_1-ForLoop

In my main.py, I started by creating 3 empty variables, two with integer data and one with an empty list.

My first for loop uses the list mission_names to count the number of missions, adding 1 to the counter variable each time.

My second for loop uses the list mission_success to check whether each item is true. If not(or else) it just passes.

Line 18 is the mathimatical calculation for the sucess rate over the ammount of missions completed multiplied by 100 to make it a percent.

My third for loop uses the list mission_years to check each item to see if it is less than 2000 and appends it to the previously empty list.

Lines 25-29 all print out the results of the for loops once the program is ran. 

total_missions(previously empty variable[amount of mission]), 
success_total(previously empty variable[amount of successful missions]),
success_rate(variable used to make mathimatical calulations), 
and b4_2000(previously empty list[appended by how many items were checked less then 2000]).
